 Abstract: 
 The main objective of Ohm Coin is to create positive change in the world by seeking out, rewarding, and offering real-world acts of kindness (giving donation).
 We purpose achieving this by using the technological platform of a versatile, open source, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency as the mechanism for delivery.
 This will keep donations transparent, ledgered, and non-bias to the greatest degree. 
 In addition, we propose an implementation of  networking nodes (Masternode/Karmanodes), distributed around the world, and offered to everyone who is willing to participate.
A governance structure entirely decentralized is being developed enabling a peer-to-peer voting network.
This will allow everyone who use OHMC as a currency to vote on the blockchain for an important acts of kindness, or open sourced technological innovations. 

As the ecosystems develop that reward abundance and giving, as opposed to taking scarcities in our current Fiat currency models, it is suggested that we can design a more emergent social structure.
The Ohm Project’s intention is to create a currency with a value associated to it, not by digital scarcity, but driven by the need for acts of kindness and the desire to fulfill them. 
Rewarding the act of giving to a greater purpose of human development is of the utmost importance for the future survival of our species.
The Ohm Coin project’s goal is to engineer a transition with blockchain technology into a more harmonic type of social design.
