**Abstract:**
 A decentralized blockchain donation platform that is versatile, open source, peer-to-peer for allocating funds where needed. This avoids any political, national, social, cultural, or religious bias from influencing acceptance of a donation campaign. As well as ensures an anonymous voting structure maintained by a distributed network of masternodes (karmanodes). This allows donations to be transparent and well documented on blockchain ledgers. 

We purpose a governance structure entirely decentralized that enables a peer-to-peer voting network. This will allow everyone who uses OHMC as a currency to vote on the blockchain for important acts of kindness or open sourced technological innovations. This type of ecosystem can have far greater implications that we ask the reader to deduce.
