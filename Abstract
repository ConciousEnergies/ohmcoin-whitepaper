**Abstract:**
 A decentralized blockchain donation platform that is versatile, open source, peer-to-peer for allocating funds where needed. This avoids any political, national, social, cultural, or religious bias from influencing acceptance of a donation campaign. As well as ensures an anonymous voting structure maintained by a distributed network of masternodes (karmanodes). This allows donations to be transparent and well documented on blockchain ledgers.
